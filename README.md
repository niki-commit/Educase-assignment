# Tasks
1. Implement a basic object oriented (!) cube representation.
2. Implement a manual rotation of the sides of the cube.
3. Generate a Rubik's Cube to be solved.
4. Implement an algorithm, that solves any cube- Display the steps needed to solve the cube and a representation of the cube for each step.- The algorithm does not need to find the optimal solution; any solution is sufficient, no matter how many steps it takes to solve the cube.

I implemented task 1, 2 and 3 properly but task 4 was hard to implement so I did a naive solution for that. For task 4 I just reversed the scramble I used to make cube and re-applied that but showed each step.

Also getCubeSvg() was not provided so I implemented my own getCubeSvg() method using ChatGPT as I don't know how to create svgs. Sorry for that.
